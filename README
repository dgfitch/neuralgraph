NeuralGraph: a mouse-driven graph editor that allows you to send signals around your graph as if it were a neural network.  Audio output triggered by nodes "firing" is coming very soon.

To use: (these controls will probably change in the not-too-distant future)


                            Empty space                    A node                       An arc
----------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Left-click            |   create a new node          select this node              select this arc
Right-click           |   deselect everything      decrease node's strength*    decrease arc's strength*
                      |
Shift-left-click      | draw an arc to new node    increase node's strength     increase arc's strength
Shift-right-click     |   deselect everything      decrease node's strength*    decrease arc's strength*
                      |
Control-left-click    |   create a new node            STIMULATE NODE!               stimulate arc
Control-right-click   |   deselect everything      decrease node's strength*    decrease arc's strength*
                      |
Alt-left-click        |   create a new node              not assigned          increase transmission time
Alt-right-click       |   deselect everything      decrease node's strength*   decrease transmission time*
----------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If a strength or transmission time is reduced to zero, the corresponding entity is destroyed.
